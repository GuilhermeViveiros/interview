## Model Optimization and Scalability

### 1. Load MNIST Using PyTorch
**Task:**  
Load the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's torchvision module and visualize the first 10 samples.

**Follow-Up:**  
Discuss preprocessing techniques to improve performance.

### 2. Visualize the Data
**Task:**  
Write a Python function to plot random images from the MNIST dataset along with their labels.

### 3. Implement Mini-batch Gradient Descent

### 4. Implement a Simple CNN to Train on MNIST
**Task:**  
Create and train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify MNIST images.

**Requirements:**
* Use ReLU activations and max pooling
* Train for at least 5 epochs

**Follow-Up:**  
Evaluate the model's accuracy and discuss possible improvements.

### 5. Add Residual Connections and regularization techniques
